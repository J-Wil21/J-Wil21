ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua Wiljoen. I'm a passionate up and coming Software Engineering. 
Working as an IT technician right now but this is a stepping stone to help me achieve my goals. 

Since June 2022 :date: I have been learning how to code and create websites. So far I have learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. Putting everything I have learnt into practice by coding different projects. Please have a look through my repository and see some of the projects I have made. 
There is still lots to learn React, Nextjs, how to use Git (More in depth), back-end tools/coding and much more...

With all of this hard work through pratice and dedication I hope to improve my skill-set and to continue to increase my knowledge. 

:star:The Goal is to become a Front-end Web developer/Software Engineering in 2023.:star: 



My journey has just started but I will become a Software Engineering.
