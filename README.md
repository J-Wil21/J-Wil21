ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua Wiljoen. I'm a passionate up and coming web developer. 
Working as an IT technician right now but this is a stepping stone of what's to come. 

Since June 2022 :date: I have been learning how to code and create websites. So far I have learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. Putting everything I have learnt into practice by coding different projects brings me enjoyment as I'm seeing the finished product. 
There is still lots to learn React, Nextjs, how to use Git, back-end tools/coding and much more...

With all of this hard work I hope to improve my skill set and to continue to increase my knowledge. 
:star:The Goal is to become a Front-end Web developer in 2023.:star: 



My journey has just started but I will become a Web developer.
